# Causal-Sensor-Fusion-for-Predicting-Machine-Failures-With-Small-Data

## Project Overview
#### Project Goal
To build a machine learning system that predicts machinery failures using causal inference, sensor fusion and small data learning techniques.

<!-- ### Why it stands out:
1. Real world industrial data is usually tiny and messy, so traditional Machine learning fails.
2. You’ll show skill in causal discovery, multimodal fusion, and noise-robust modeling — rare and high-value.-->
