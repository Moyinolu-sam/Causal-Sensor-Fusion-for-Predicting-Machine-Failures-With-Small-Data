# Causal-Sensor-Fusion-for-Predicting-Machine-Failures-With-Small-Data

## Project Overview
<!-- #### Project Goal
To build a machine learning system that predicts machinery failures using causal inference, sensor fusion and small data learning techniques.

### Why it stands out:
1. Real world industrial data is usually tiny and messy, so traditional Machine learning fails.
2. You’ll show skill in causal discovery, multimodal fusion, and noise-robust modeling — rare and high-value.-->
Most industrial systems like manufacturing machines, turbines, pumps and motors produce multiple noisy sensor streams.
Traditional machine learning models struggle here because the data is:Small, Noisy and Non-linear.

This project builds a complete pipeline that predicts machine failures using causal inference and sensor fusion, making the model more robust and interpretable in realistic small data environments.
